# Fibroid and Adenomyosis Classification
This repository is a deep learning project for classifying ultrasound images with labels of Fibroid, Adenomyosis and None of the above.

This repository is organised as follows:
1) Pre-Processing Pipeline - This Directory Contains the work of the preprocessing pipeline developed for the ultrasound images.
2) Model Comparison - This Directory contains the files before and after the pipeline application with the usage of Deep Learning Models.
3) UNet Implementation - Contains the work of custom-developed ANN as the backbone of UNet and trained over the obtained dataset of images.

# Availability of the Dataset - 
The images used in this dataset are not available for public use and were provided by the hospital with which the study was associated.
